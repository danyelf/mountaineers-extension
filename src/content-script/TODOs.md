TODOs

1. Progress meter on reading (activities read so far)
1. Consider upgrading the whole thing to React so the control panel stays in sync when you click on/off different activity types
1. On personal pages, break up activity types into groups
1. Make sure THIS activity isn't listed
1. Do we want a better data storage format? (e.g. duckdb-embed?)
1. FIX personal name bug
