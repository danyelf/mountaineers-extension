Notes to self:
5/27: does not decorate pages like
https://www.mountaineers.org/locations-lodges/seattle-branch/committees/seattle-climbing-committee/course-templates/alpine-climbing-courses/basic-alpine-climbing-course/activities/seattle-basic-alpine-sig-field-trip-overnight-snow-scrambling-snoqualmie-summit-west-4
(Really, it should)

Should decorate person pages, too

need to fuck around with tooltip -- how can I get box to be big enough?
